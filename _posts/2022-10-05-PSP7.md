Theme 5: Impact of phosphorus on environmental quality and on biodiversity

Several actions have been carried out in the Santa Lucia River basin (1.343.300 ha) in order to reduce
the impact of anthropogenic pressure and improve water quality. Environmental models may be used
as supportive tools when assessing the effect of local actions at a basin scale. To have a better
understanding of which is the best combination of strategies and management guidelines that may
result in an improvement of water quality, a SWAT model was built in the Santa Lucia River basin for
the 1983-2019 period. In this context, the objective of this work is to present the progress made in the
development of the model and to describe the scenarios in which phosphorus fluxes can be predicted
with the implemented tool. Local data was collected and used as an input for the model: DEM,
cartographic and physicochemical representative soil data and 2015 land use map, crop rotation
sequences, fertilization dates and doses, point source discharges. Climatological forcing was built with
41 rainfall stations and one agro climatological station. Eight flow gauges were used to calibrate and
validate the model using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm (SUFI-2). The model performance was
evaluated using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Kling-Grupta efficiency (KGE), obtaining values
between 0.65 and 0.82 and between 0.68-0.87 respectively. This tool can predict phosphorus fluxes
between soil and water for various scenarios such as sub superficial phosphate fertilization, vegetative
mining, buffer zones, land use changes, downstream dilution effects of reservoirs, which will support
decision making in water and soil resources planning in Uruguay.
